# Bootstrap-Portfolio


## Description

I have designed and created a portfolio through the use of Bootstrap 4. I have applied what I have learnt about the grid system and display flex to use as much of Bootstrap's built-in CSS to keep my custom CSS as minimal as possible. The webpage has also been designed to be repsonsive according to different screen sizes which will ensure the best viewing experience according to screen size. This will continue to be updated as my skills develop and my project cards will be filled with details of any projects I work on.
